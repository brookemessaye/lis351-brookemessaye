                    <p> My name is Brooke Messaye. I am a 19-year-old junior attending the University of Wisconsin-Madison majoring in Journalism on both the Reporting and the Strategic Communications track with a certificate in Sports Communications, Digital
                        Media Studies, and Criminal Justice. I am a recipient of the POSSE scholarship, a full-tuition academic and leadership scholarship. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, graduating from Palisades Charter High School.
                        After getting my bachelor’s, I intend to go to law school and get my JD/MBA in sports management. My ultimate career goal is to work at a law firm as a sports or entertainment lawyer or manager. Another route I want to take after
                        graduating is becoming a sports broadcaster. I am one of the founders behind @BIPOCATWISCO. I just completed a summer internship at the entertainment company STAYMACRO working in their social media and brand department and am looking
                        to continue down the path of working in the entertainment industry. I also am a writer for Madison’s student newspaper, The Daily Cardinal, and am the copy editor for The Black Voice, a magazine and online publication for marginalized
                        voices. I work as the student social media and graphic design intern for the Multicultural Student center and am the sports marketing intern for RealPlay Sports.
